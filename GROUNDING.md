# Doric Grounding

Last reviewed: 2026-06-22

This is Doric's repository validity contract. Every agent working in this
repository must read it before non-trivial planning, reviewing, artifact
generation, architecture discussion, code editing, or workflow execution.

## Authority

Use this authority order:

1. System and runtime safety instructions.
2. Hard Constraints in this document.
3. Explicit user-approved constraints for the current task.
4. Current repository code, manifests, tests, and generated contracts.
5. Project agent instructions and task-specific skills.
6. The current task prompt.
7. Convention Parameters in this document.
8. Agent preference or local judgment.

Hard Constraints are gates. If a prompt conflicts with one, stop, cite the HC
ID, explain the conflict, and ask for user direction only when the constraint
allows a scoped human decision.

Convention Parameters are defaults. Follow them unless the task has a clear
reason to do otherwise, and record meaningful deviations where useful.

## Product Direction

Doric is a TypeScript-first agent-core project.

Current product work should focus on the agent runtime and its direct support
surfaces:

- prompt, message, and context handling;
- model/provider abstraction;
- tool definition, invocation, and result handling;
- agent loop control and structured events;
- error, cancellation, retry, and minimal state interfaces when justified.

The repository is not currently grounded in the former Rust CLI, daemon,
worker, lifecycle, TUI, slash-command, service, or multi-process architecture.
Those terms are out-of-scope markers unless the user explicitly expands the
product scope and current files support the change.

`agents/doric` may host the explicitly requested minimal A2A protocol scaffold
for the Doric agent. That scaffold does not by itself add CLI, daemon,
provider, persistence, or broader host-surface scope.

`agents/doric` receives first-message config and later config replacements from
`requestContext.userMessage.metadata.configuration`. Sandbox creation, Git
setup, repository cloning, and initial workdir state are tied to session
creation; later config replacement updates only the stored session config.

Doric supports OpenAI and Codex as separate provider types. The Codex provider
uses the existing provider token field for the Codex authorization value and
derives Codex-compatible account headers from that credential when available.
Credential values must remain private runtime inputs: do not persist, log, or
echo resolved tokens.

The Codex OAuth profile is a package-owned default for the Codex browser
authorization flow. Host scripts should require only `CODEX_AUTHORIZATION` for
normal runtime use and let the OAuth package provide Codex's client id,
localhost callback route, connector scopes, and authorize-request parameters
unless an explicit override is needed for testing or a provider change. Codex
model requests use ChatGPT's Codex Responses backend with the ChatGPT access
token; they do not request the public OpenAI `api.responses.write` OAuth
scope. The ChatGPT Codex backend requires streaming requests with
`store: false` and non-empty instructions; non-streaming provider calls should
be fulfilled by consuming the streaming backend response. Codex requests must
not forward unsupported public Responses API controls such as `temperature`.

## Repository Shape

Doric is an Nx-managed TypeScript workspace with npm workspaces for
`agents/*`, `packages/*`, `tools/*`, and `workflows/*`.

Use current manifests and source as the package inventory. Do not treat this
file as the source of truth for every package responsibility.

Durable boundaries:

- product packages live under `packages/*`;
- agent entry surfaces live under `agents/*`;
- standalone tool packages live under `tools/*`;
- workflow packages live under `workflows/*`;
- package APIs should be exported through public entrypoints;
- sibling packages should not deep-import another package's private source.

Before adding a package or boundary, identify the responsibility that makes it
deeper than a folder: a stable public contract, separate test boundary,
dependency-direction boundary, or proven second consumer.

## Runtime Boundaries

The target runtime is an embeddable TypeScript agent core usable from tests and
future host surfaces without coupling the agent to a specific CLI, daemon,
worker, UI, provider, or process model.

Keep provider integration behind TypeScript interfaces. Do not make one
provider the only runtime path unless the task is intentionally a narrow first
slice.

Keep tool behavior behind explicit, typed, testable interfaces. Do not add host
command execution, network access, filesystem mutation, credential handling,
persistence, or session behavior without explicit scope and validation.

Credentials and secrets must not be persisted, printed, logged, or committed.
Prefer dependency injection and explicit configuration objects for sensitive
runtime inputs.

## Hard Constraints

### HC-001 Grounding Is Mandatory Context

Agents must read this document before non-trivial planning, reviewing,
artifact generation, architecture discussion, code editing, or workflow
execution.

Enforcement: if this document cannot be read, stop and report that the
repository grounding contract cannot be satisfied.

### HC-002 Current Repository State Is Authoritative

Current code, manifests, tests, and generated contracts beat memory,
assumptions, stale documentation, older summaries, and generic model knowledge.

Enforcement: verify current files before making architecture claims or changing
architecture-relevant behavior. Mark uncertain or future behavior as uncertain.

### HC-003 Keep Scope To The TypeScript Agent

New product work belongs in the TypeScript agent core unless the user
explicitly expands the scope.

Enforcement: do not add or design CLI, daemon, worker, lifecycle service, TUI,
slash-command, Rust product packages, or multi-process behavior without
explicit user approval for that scope.

### HC-004 Respect Minimal Boundaries

Do not add package splits, host/runtime boundaries, provider coupling, tool
privileges, persistence layers, or process orchestration before they are needed
by the agent core.

Enforcement: inspect current manifests and source before changing package
layout, public APIs, provider composition, tool registration, event streaming,
session persistence, config schema, or runtime behavior.

### HC-005 Preserve Unrelated Worktree Changes

Do not revert, overwrite, delete, stage, or commit unrelated user, maintainer,
or sub-agent changes.

Enforcement: inspect status before edits and commits. Keep write scope small.
Use destructive recovery only with explicit user approval and verified target
paths.

### HC-006 Validate Before Claiming Completion

Do not claim code, docs, workflows, or generated artifacts are complete or
working without appropriate evidence.

Enforcement: run relevant checks or state clearly why they could not be run and
what risk remains.

### HC-007 Protect Sensitive And Boundary Surfaces

Do not weaken security, privacy, permission, sandbox, command-execution,
network, authentication, secret-storage, config, or session boundaries without
explicit approval and validation.

Enforcement: stop for review before expanding command execution, network
access, credential handling, repository mutation, or persisted config/session
behavior.

### HC-008 Generated, Vendored, Lock, And Build Artifacts Need Provenance

Do not casually hand-edit generated contracts, vendored code, lockfiles,
schemas, or build outputs.

Enforcement: use the repository-approved generation, formatting, or validation
path when one exists, and explain why the artifact changed.

### HC-009 Human Gates Must Be Explicit

When scope, product tradeoffs, safety exceptions, destructive actions, missing
approval, or validation substitutions require human judgment, ask the user and
record the answer where useful.

Enforcement: do not treat silence, model confidence, or relative ranking as
user approval.

## Convention Parameters

| ID     | Convention                                     | Default                                                                    | Deviation rule                                                            |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CP-001 | Prefer the agent-only direction.               | Keep product work focused on the TypeScript agent core.                    | Explain why the task needs a larger product surface.                      |
| CP-002 | Prefer narrow, evidence-backed changes.        | Edit only files needed for the task and validate the touched behavior.     | Explain why a broader change is required.                                 |
| CP-003 | Prefer TypeScript and Nx-native commands.      | Use configured TypeScript, Nx, and formatter commands before substitutes.  | Explain tool absence, sandbox limits, or why a fallback proves the claim. |
| CP-004 | Prefer small interfaces over early frameworks. | Add minimal TypeScript contracts that can be tested directly.              | Explain why a larger abstraction is justified now.                        |
| CP-005 | Prefer progressive discovery.                  | Read only the grounding, instructions, manifests, and source needed.       | Broaden search when the task crosses boundaries or evidence is missing.   |
| CP-006 | Prefer durable provenance.                     | Name changed files, validation commands, decisions, and generated outputs. | Explain why provenance cannot be recorded.                                |
| CP-007 | Prefer implementation over chat-only advice.   | Land requested repository deliverables in files and verify them.           | Explain any blocker that prevents file changes.                           |
| CP-008 | Prefer Nx-managed package boundaries.          | Use Nx-visible workspace packages and public package entrypoints.          | Explain why a folder, manual scaffold, or direct source import is safer.  |
