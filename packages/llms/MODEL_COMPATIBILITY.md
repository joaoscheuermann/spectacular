# Unified model compatibility

Research checked on 2026-08-08. This is a transport and behavioral contract,
not a claim that every model from a laboratory supports every feature.
OpenRouter's live `supported_parameters` for the selected model is authoritative
for routing; the laboratory profile supplies only known behavioral constraints
and a conservative fallback when discovery is unavailable.

## Normalized contract

`createUnifiedProvider` keeps the public `LlmProvider` request and response
types while using OpenRouter Chat Completions underneath.

- Tool requests map `toolChoice`, advertised `parallelToolCalls`,
  strict-compatible tool schemas, assistant tool calls, tool results, and
  opaque `reasoning_details`.
- `parallelToolCalls` is sent only when the live model catalog advertises
  `parallel_tool_calls`; otherwise it is omitted so parameter-required routing
  can still select a tool-capable endpoint. `false` always adds a short
  model-facing instruction to call at most one tool in that response. Agent
  runs still validate an entire tool batch atomically before any handler runs.
- Direct tool-free structured output selects `json_schema`, then `json_object`,
  then a JSON Schema system instruction from live capabilities. Every result is
  parsed with JSON and validated with the original Zod schema; invalid output
  receives at most two local correction attempts.
- Direct structured streams are atomic: the provider buffers and validates the
  completion before emitting its text and `response.finished` event.
- Tools plus direct `schema` fail explicitly. Tool-enabled structured Agent runs
  use the reserved terminal tool contract instead.
- Native parameters use OpenRouter `provider.require_parameters: true`. A
  feature that cannot be emulated fails before completion; it is never silently
  downgraded.
- The adapter never writes raw tokenizer control tokens into an OpenRouter
  prompt. OpenRouter/inference endpoints own the model chat template.

## Live conformance

The opt-in matrix runs one strict structured case and one two-turn tool/replay
case across 13 representative model families. It fails closed if a model or
price is missing, estimates a five-call-per-model worst case, refuses estimates
above USD 5, and treats every model failure as gating. Each call permits up to
1,024 output tokens so reasoning models can finish the small visible answer.
Pino progress and safe provider diagnostics are written to stderr while stdout
remains reserved for the final JSON report. Set `LLMS_CONFORMANCE_LOG_LEVEL` to
change the default `debug` verbosity.

```sh
npx nx run llms:conformance-live -- --yes-paid-conformance
```

Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` only in the runtime environment. The live matrix is
paid and is not part of the ordinary test target.
